# PixelSearch-ImageSearch-CSharp

A pretty fast PixelSearch library to be used in C# projects.

Current Features:
* A pretty fast pixel searcher
  * A "single" threaded pixelsearcher is available
  * A multithreaded/pixel searcher using Parallelism is also available, limited to the amount of threads your cpu has.
  
* A decent image searcher (work in progress, credit to original creator of that snippet)

Currently working on a threaded version of the pixel searcher.

A precompiled .dll is available under Releases.
Keep in mind that the latest code will probably be available first via this repository (meaning you have to clone/download the repository from here and compile it yourself)

See repository "Pixel Searcher Libray Example" for how to use it
