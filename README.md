# PixelSearch-ImageSearch-CSharp

A pretty fast PixelSearch library to be used in C# projects.

Current Features:
* A pretty fast pixel searcher
* A decent image searcher (work in progress, credit to original creator of that snippet)

Currently working on a threaded version of the pixel searcher.

A precompiled .dll is available under Releases.

See repository "Pixel Searcher Libray Example" for how to use it
